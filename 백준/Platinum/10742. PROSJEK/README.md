### 문제 설명

<p>You are given an array of N integers. Find a consecutive subsequence of numbers of the length at least K that has the maximal possible average.</p>

<p>Please note: the average of a subsequence is the sum of all the numbers in the subsequence divided by its length.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The first line of input contains two integers N (1 ≤ N ≤ 3·10<sup>5</sup>) and K (1 ≤ K ≤ N). The second line of input contains N integers a<sub>i</sub> (1 ≤ a<sub>i</sub> ≤ 10<sup>6</sup>).</p>

### 출력 

 <p>The first and only line of output must contain the maximal possible average. An absolute deviation of ±0.001 from the official solution is permitted.</p>
